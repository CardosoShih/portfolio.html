<h3><p>50 First Dates</p></h3>
This movie is funny and cute, I could watch it everyday!!

<p><h3>The Notebook</p></h3>
This is more dramatic, but the love story always makes me cry!

<h3><p> Just Like Heaven</p></h3>
This movie is at this list because is sweet, corny and I used to watch with my sibilings and it brings me a good memory
