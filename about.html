<h3>Hi, I'm Tati!</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a curious and adventurous person on a quest to learn how to code in a fun and affordable way. I'm determined to pursue a career in the exciting world of tech!</p>
    <p>But here's the twist: I also have a deep passion for psychology and child development. So, I'm on a mission to blend these two worlds together!</p>
    <p>On this website, I'll be showcasing my portfolio of projects that I've created through my Udemy courses and some awesome side projects I've been working on.</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to create an engaging and interactive website that both kids and adults will love. Imagine a website where you can learn Portuguese in a super fun way, 
        <p>or a cool game designed specifically for neurodivergent individuals. The possibilities are endless!</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for visiting my website. I'm thrilled to have you here with me on this journey. Let's make learning and exploring together!</p>


</p>
<p>
Thanks again and see ya!!
