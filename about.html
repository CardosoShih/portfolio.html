<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi!!
My name is Tatiane, I am 27 years old, and I am a very curious person who wants to learn how to code in a easy and not so expensive way, to get a carrer into Tech.
I am trying to find a way to keep my passion about Psychology and Child Development and Tech.
My idea with this website is to show my portfolio with projects created with the classes I am taking in Udemy and also my side projects.
As a goal I have an idea of creating an website that contains interesting and fun thins for an child and adults to see, learn and interact. Maybe a website that teaches Portuguese for free, since I am from Brazil and I lvoe to teach.
Or maybe an website/game for people in the ASD spectrum, I have many years of experience with childrens and teens in the ASD.
Anyway, thanks for reading all this, it is as pleasure to me that youre here visiting my website.


Thanks again and see ya!!
